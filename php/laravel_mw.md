# Middleware


## Where to run MW
- A. `web.php`
    - MWを個別に設定する時はここに書く
- B. `app/http/kernel.php`
    - Global MWなどはここに書く

```php
class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    /**
     * The application's global HTTP middleware stack.
     * These middleware are run during every request to your application.
     */
    protected $middleware = [
        \App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
    ];

    /**
     * The application's route middleware groups.
     */
    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        'web' => [
            \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
        ],
        'api' => [
            'throttle:60,1',
            \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        ],
    ];

    /**
     * The application's route middleware.
     * These middleware may be assigned to groups or used individually.
     */
    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'auth' => \App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
    ];

    /**
     * The priority-sorted list of middleware.
     * This forces non-global middleware to always be in the given order.
     */
    protected $middlewarePriority = [
        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
    ];
}
```
